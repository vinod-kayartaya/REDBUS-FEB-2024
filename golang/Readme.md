# Go Programming Language Essentials

This 7-day training program is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the Go programming language, commonly known as Golang. The curriculum is structured to cover essential topics ranging from language fundamentals to advanced concepts like concurrency, working with databases, and creating REST APIs.

## Objectives:

- **Day 1-2: Establishing Foundations**
  - Understand the basics of Go syntax and language fundamentals.
  - Learn to work with the Go package ecosystem, both standard and third-party packages.
- **Day 3-4: Mastering Types and Concurrency**
  - Explore the Go type system, including structs, methods, and interfaces.
  - Gain proficiency in concurrent programming with Goroutines, Channels, and synchronization.
- **Day 5-6: Practical Application with Databases and REST APIs**
  - Develop skills in working with databases using the `database/sql` package.
  - Create RESTful APIs in Go, covering HTTP handling, routing, and middleware.
- **Day 7: Testing and Quality Assurance**
  - Learn the principles of unit testing in Go using the `testing` package.
  - Understand the importance of testing for code quality, reliability, and maintainability.

## Duration:

- **Training Duration:** 7 days
- **Daily Session Length:** 3 to 4 hours for theory/demonstration by the trainier and 3 to 4 hours for students to work on lab exercises

## Prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, control flow, functions).
- Familiarity with any programming language (though not mandatory) can be advantageous.
- Prior exposure to web development concepts is helpful but not required.

This training is designed for individuals looking to enhance their programming skills with Go or transition to Go from another language. Participants will gain hands-on experience through practical examples and exercises, ensuring a solid foundation for building scalable and efficient applications using the Go programming language.

### Day 5: Working with Databases

- Overview of database/sql package
- Connecting to databases
- Executing queries and handling results
- Using prepared statements for efficiency
- Working with transactions
- Handling database errors
- Exploring popular Go database drivers (e.g., `pq` for PostgreSQL)

### Day 6: Creating Rest APIs

- Introduction to HTTP in Go
- Creating a simple HTTP server
- Handling HTTP requests and responses
- Routing in Go (e.g., using `gorilla/mux`)
- Creating RESTful APIs
- Middleware for request processing
- JSON handling in Go

### Day 7: Unit Testing

- Basics of testing in Go
- Writing unit tests using the `testing` package
- Running tests using `go test`
- Table-driven tests for multiple input scenarios
- Mocking in Go using interfaces
- Code coverage and profiling with `go test`
- Best practices for writing effective tests

Note: Each day's content builds upon the previous days, creating a structured learning path for participants to gradually master the fundamentals and advanced features of the Go programming language.

## Software setup required for the Go Programming Language Essentials training:

1. **Go Programming Language:**

   - Download and install the latest stable version of Go from the official website: [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
   - Set up the Go environment variables (GOROOT, GOPATH, and PATH) as per the official installation instructions.

2. **Text Editor or IDE:**

   - Choose a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing Go code. Some popular options include:
     - Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with the Go extension

3. **Database (Optional for Day 5):**

   - If you plan to work with databases, install the database of your choice (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) and make sure it is running.
   - Install the appropriate Go database driver, such as `pq` for PostgreSQL.

4. **REST API Testing Tool (Optional for Day 6):**

   - For testing REST APIs, consider using tools like:
     - Postman
     - Insomnia
     - curl (command-line tool)

Ensure that all installations are successful and that you can create and run a simple Go program before starting the training. Participants are encouraged to have their development environment set up prior to the training to maximize the learning experience.
