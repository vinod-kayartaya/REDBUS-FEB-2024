# Data analysis using Python

## Introduction to NumPy

NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is one of the most fundamental libraries used in Python for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is an essential tool for data scientists, engineers, and researchers working with numerical data in Python.

Here's a detailed introduction to NumPy:

1. **Arrays**: At the core of NumPy is the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) object, which represents a multi-dimensional, homogeneous array of fixed-size items. These arrays can have any number of dimensions and contain elements of the same data type, making them highly efficient for numerical computations.

2. **Vectorized Operations**: NumPy provides a vast array of functions and operators that operate element-wise on arrays, eliminating the need for explicit looping in Python code. This vectorized approach to computation is much faster and more concise than traditional iterative approaches.

3. **Mathematical Functions**: NumPy includes a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions for performing various operations such as trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, statistical functions, and more. These functions are optimized for array operations and are much faster than their pure Python counterparts.

4. **Broadcasting**: NumPy's broadcasting mechanism allows for arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes. When performing operations on arrays with different dimensions, NumPy automatically broadcasts the arrays to make their shapes compatible, enabling efficient element-wise operations.

5. **Indexing and Slicing**: NumPy provides powerful indexing and slicing capabilities for accessing and manipulating elements within arrays. You can use array indexing to extract specific elements, slices, or subarrays efficiently, making it easy to work with large datasets.

6. **Linear Algebra Operations**: NumPy includes a wide range of linear algebra functions for performing operations such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition (SVD), and more. These functions are critical for many scientific and engineering applications.

7. **Random Number Generation**: NumPy features a robust random number generation module (`numpy.random`) for generating arrays of random numbers from various probability distributions. This module is useful for tasks such as simulations, statistical sampling, and generating random data.

8. **Integration with other Libraries**: NumPy seamlessly integrates with other scientific computing libraries in the Python ecosystem, such as SciPy, pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn. This interoperability makes it easy to combine NumPy arrays with data structures from other libraries and leverage their respective functionalities.

### NumPy Arrays

NumPy arrays, often referred to as `ndarrays`, are the cornerstone data structure of the NumPy library. They represent multi-dimensional, homogeneous arrays with a fixed size. NumPy arrays enable efficient storage and manipulation of large datasets, making them essential for numerical computing tasks. Here's an overview of NumPy arrays:

1. **Homogeneous Data Types**: NumPy arrays contain elements of the same data type, which allows for efficient storage and computation. This homogeneity contrasts with Python lists, which can contain elements of different types.

2. **Multi-dimensional**: NumPy arrays can have any number of dimensions. A 1-dimensional array is similar to a Python list, while 2-dimensional arrays resemble matrices. NumPy supports arrays with an arbitrary number of dimensions, enabling the representation of complex data structures.

3. **Fixed Size**: Once created, the size of a NumPy array remains fixed. Elements can be modified, but the array's shape cannot be changed without creating a new array. This fixed size enables efficient memory allocation and access.

4. **Efficient Computation**: NumPy arrays support vectorized operations, allowing mathematical operations to be performed on entire arrays at once. This approach eliminates the need for explicit looping over array elements, resulting in faster execution times compared to equivalent Python code using lists.

5. **Creation of Arrays**: NumPy provides several methods for creating arrays:

   - Using Python lists or tuples: `np.array([1, 2, 3])`
   - Using NumPy functions: `np.zeros((3, 3))` creates a 3x3 array of zeros.
   - Using NumPy's random module: `np.random.rand(2, 2)` creates a 2x2 array of random numbers.
   - Using predefined functions like `np.linspace()` or `np.arange()` to generate arrays with evenly spaced values.

6. **Indexing and Slicing**: NumPy arrays support powerful indexing and slicing operations, similar to Python lists. Elements within arrays can be accessed using integer indices, and subarrays can be extracted using slicing notation. For multi-dimensional arrays, indices and slices can be specified along each dimension.

7. **Broadcasting**: NumPy arrays support broadcasting, which allows for arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes. During broadcasting, NumPy automatically adjusts the shapes of arrays to make them compatible for element-wise operations, enabling concise and efficient code.

8. **Universal Functions (ufuncs)**: NumPy provides a wide range of universal functions, or ufuncs, which operate element-wise on arrays. These functions include mathematical operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication), trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponentials, and more. Ufuncs are highly optimized for performance and support broadcasting.

### Array operations and functions

NumPy provides a wide range of array operations and functions for performing various tasks on NumPy arrays efficiently. These operations and functions are optimized for numerical computing tasks and are an essential part of NumPy's functionality. Here's an overview of some common array operations and functions in NumPy:

1. **Element-wise Operations**: NumPy supports element-wise arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between arrays. These operations can be performed using arithmetic operators or NumPy's functions (`np.add()`, `np.subtract()`, `np.multiply()`, `np.divide()`).

```python
import numpy as np

# Element-wise addition
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = a + b  # Output: [5 7 9]
```

2. **Array Broadcasting**: NumPy arrays support broadcasting, allowing for operations between arrays with different shapes. Broadcasting automatically adjusts the dimensions of arrays to make them compatible for element-wise operations.

```python
# Broadcasting example
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])
result = a + b  # Output: [[11 22 33] [14 25 36]]
```

3. **Universal Functions (ufuncs)**: NumPy provides a collection of universal functions (`ufuncs`) that operate element-wise on arrays. These functions include mathematical operations, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and more.

```python
# Example of ufuncs
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
result = np.square(a)  # Square each element: [1 4 9]
result = np.sin(a)     # Compute sine of each element
result = np.exp(a)     # Compute exponential of each element
```

4. **Aggregation Functions**: NumPy offers functions for aggregating array elements, such as computing the sum, mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation of array values.

```python
# Aggregation functions
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
result = np.sum(a)        # Compute sum: 15
result = np.mean(a)       # Compute mean: 3.0
result = np.median(a)     # Compute median: 3.0
result = np.min(a)        # Find minimum value: 1
result = np.max(a)        # Find maximum value: 5
result = np.var(a)        # Compute variance
result = np.std(a)        # Compute standard deviation
```

5. **Array Manipulation Functions**: NumPy provides functions for reshaping, concatenating, splitting, and transposing arrays.

```python
# Array manipulation functions
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
result = np.reshape(a, (1, 4))  # Reshape array
result = np.concatenate((a, a), axis=0)  # Concatenate arrays
result = np.split(a, 2, axis=1)  # Split array
result = np.transpose(a)  # Transpose array
```

6. **Linear Algebra Operations**: NumPy offers linear algebra functions for matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, eigenvalue decomposition, singular value decomposition (SVD), and more.

```python
# Linear algebra operations
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
result = np.dot(a, b)           # Matrix multiplication
result = np.linalg.inv(a)       # Matrix inversion
result = np.linalg.eig(a)       # Eigenvalue decomposition
result = np.linalg.svd(a)       # Singular value decomposition
```

### Indexing and slicing

Indexing and slicing are fundamental operations in NumPy for accessing and manipulating elements within arrays. They allow you to extract specific elements, rows, columns, or subarrays from NumPy arrays efficiently. Here's a detailed explanation of indexing and slicing in NumPy:

1. **Indexing**:
   - Indexing in NumPy arrays works similarly to indexing in Python lists. You can access individual elements of a NumPy array using integer indices.
   - NumPy arrays support positive and negative indexing, where negative indices count from the end of the array.
   - For multi-dimensional arrays, indices are provided as a tuple separated by commas, with each index corresponding to a specific dimension.
   - Indices start from 0 and go up to (array_length - 1) in each dimension.

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Accessing individual elements
print(arr[0])    # Output: 1
print(arr[-1])   # Output: 5

# Multi-dimensional array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Accessing elements in a 2D array
print(arr_2d[0, 1])   # Output: 2 (element at row 0, column 1)
```

2. **Slicing**:
   - Slicing allows you to extract a portion of an array by specifying a range of indices.
   - The syntax for slicing is `start:stop:step`, where `start` is the starting index (inclusive), `stop` is the ending index (exclusive), and `step` is the step size.
   - Omitting `start` and `stop` defaults to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.
   - Slicing can be performed independently along each dimension of a multi-dimensional array.

```python
# Slicing examples
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Extracting a slice
print(arr[1:4])   # Output: [2 3 4]

# Multi-dimensional array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# Extracting a subarray
print(arr_2d[:2, 1:])  # Output: [[2 3] [5 6]]
```

3. **Advanced Indexing**:
   - NumPy also supports advanced indexing techniques, where you can use arrays or tuples of indices to extract elements or subarrays.
   - Advanced indexing allows for more flexibility in selecting elements from arrays based on specific conditions or patterns.

```python
# Advanced indexing example
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
indices = np.array([0, 2, 4])

# Using an array of indices to select elements
print(arr[indices])   # Output: [1 3 5]

# Boolean indexing
mask = arr > 2
print(arr[mask])   # Output: [3 4 5]
```

### Broadcasting in NumPy

Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism in NumPy that allows arrays with different shapes to be combined and operate together in arithmetic operations. Broadcasting automatically adjusts the dimensions of arrays to make them compatible for element-wise operations, making it easier to write concise and efficient code. Here's a detailed explanation of broadcasting in NumPy:

1. **Broadcasting Rules**:

   - Broadcasting in NumPy follows a set of rules to determine how arrays with different shapes can be combined:
     1. If the arrays have a different number of dimensions, the shape of the smaller array is padded with ones on the left until both shapes have the same length.
     2. The sizes of corresponding dimensions are compared. If the sizes are equal or one of them is 1, the arrays are compatible for broadcasting.
     3. If the sizes of corresponding dimensions are neither equal nor one of them is 1, broadcasting fails, and NumPy raises an error.

2. **Broadcasting Example**:
   - Consider adding a scalar to a one-dimensional array. The scalar is broadcasted to match the shape of the array, and then the addition operation is performed element-wise.

```python
import numpy as np

# One-dimensional array
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
scalar = 5

# Broadcasting scalar to match the shape of array 'a'
result = a + scalar  # Output: [6 7 8]
```

3. **Broadcasting with Arrays of Different Shapes**:
   - Broadcasting also works with arrays of different shapes. In this case, the smaller array is broadcasted to match the shape of the larger array before performing element-wise operations.

```python
# Arrays with different shapes
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])

# Broadcasting array 'b' to match the shape of array 'a'
result = a + b
# Output:
# [[11 22 33]
#  [14 25 36]]
```

4. **Broadcasting Limitations**:
   - While broadcasting is powerful, it has limitations. In particular, you need to be cautious when working with large arrays to avoid excessive memory usage.
   - Broadcasting can also lead to unintended behavior if not used correctly. It's essential to understand the broadcasting rules and ensure compatibility between arrays before performing operations.

```python
# Broadcasting limitations
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([[10], [20]])

# Broadcasting arrays 'b' and 'a' will raise a ValueError
# because their shapes are not compatible for broadcasting.
result = a + b
```

## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is a popular open-source Python library that provides high-performance data manipulation and analysis tools. It is built on top of NumPy and is designed to work seamlessly with heterogeneous, labeled data, making it a powerful tool for data wrangling and exploration.

### Series and DataFrames

In Pandas, `Series` and `DataFrame` are two fundamental data structures used for working with labeled data in Python. They provide powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Here's a detailed explanation of `Series` and `DataFrame`:

1. **Series**:
   - A `Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type (integers, floats, strings, etc.).
   - It consists of two main components: the index and the data.
   - The index is a label associated with each element in the Series, which can be of any immutable data type (e.g., integers, strings, dates).
   - Series can be created from Python lists, NumPy arrays, dictionaries, or scalar values.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Creating a Series from a Python list
data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
s = pd.Series(data)

# Creating a Series with custom index
data = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40, 'e': 50}
s = pd.Series(data)
```

2. **DataFrame**:
   - A `DataFrame` is a two-dimensional labeled data structure resembling a table with rows and columns.
   - It is composed of one or more Series, where each column represents a Series.
   - Like Series, DataFrames have both row and column indices.
   - DataFrames can be created from Python dictionaries, NumPy arrays, lists of dictionaries, CSV files, Excel files, SQL databases, and more.

```python
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
        'Age': [25, 30, 35],
        'City': ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago']}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Creating a DataFrame from a list of dictionaries
data = [{'Name': 'Alice', 'Age': 25, 'City': 'New York'},
        {'Name': 'Bob', 'Age': 30, 'City': 'Los Angeles'},
        {'Name': 'Charlie', 'Age': 35, 'City': 'Chicago'}]
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

3. **Accessing Data**:
   - Both Series and DataFrames support various methods for accessing and manipulating data.
   - You can access elements using integer-based indexing, label-based indexing, or boolean indexing.

```python
# Accessing data in a Series
print(s[0])       # Accessing by integer index
print(s['a'])     # Accessing by label index
print(s[s > 20])  # Boolean indexing

# Accessing data in a DataFrame
print(df['Name'])        # Accessing a column by name
print(df.loc[0])         # Accessing a row by label index
print(df.iloc[0])        # Accessing a row by integer index
print(df.loc[0, 'Name']) # Accessing a specific element
```

4. **Manipulating Data**:
   - Both Series and DataFrames provide methods for manipulating data, such as adding or removing elements, modifying values, and performing mathematical operations.

```python
# Manipulating data in a Series
s['f'] = 60        # Adding a new element
s.drop('a', inplace=True)  # Removing an element
s = s * 2          # Multiplying all elements by 2

# Manipulating data in a DataFrame
df['Age'] = df['Age'] + 5  # Modifying values in a column
df.drop(0, inplace=True)   # Removing a row
df['Salary'] = [50000, 60000, 70000]  # Adding a new column
```

5. **Visualization**:
   - Both Series and DataFrames can be visualized using built-in plotting methods or by integrating with visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting a Series
s.plot(kind='bar')
plt.show()

# Plotting a DataFrame
df.plot(x='Name', y='Age', kind='bar')
plt.show()
```

### Reading and manipulating data with Pandas

Reading and manipulating data with Pandas involves several steps, including reading data from external sources, performing data manipulation and cleaning, and analyzing or visualizing the data. Here's a detailed guide on how to read and manipulate data with Pandas:

### Reading Data

1. **Reading from CSV**:
   - Use `pd.read_csv()` to read data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Reading data from a CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
```

2. **Reading from Excel**:
   - Use `pd.read_excel()` to read data from an Excel file into a DataFrame.

```python
# Reading data from an Excel file
df = pd.read_excel('data.xlsx')
```

3. **Reading from SQL Database**:
   - Use `pd.read_sql()` to read data from a SQL database into a DataFrame.

```python
import sqlite3

# Establishing connection to SQLite database
conn = sqlite3.connect('database.db')

# Reading data from a SQL database
query = "SELECT * FROM table_name"
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
```

### Data Manipulation and Cleaning

1. **Viewing Data**:
   - Use `df.head()` or `df.tail()` to view the first or last few rows of the DataFrame.

```python
# Viewing the first few rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

2. **Selecting Columns**:
   - Use square brackets or dot notation to select specific columns of the DataFrame.

```python
# Selecting a single column
column = df['column_name']
# or
column = df.column_name
```

3. **Filtering Data**:
   - Use boolean indexing to filter rows based on conditions.

```python
# Filtering rows based on condition
filtered_data = df[df['column_name'] > 50]
```

4. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Use methods like `isna()`, `fillna()`, or `dropna()` to handle missing or null values in the DataFrame.

```python
# Checking for missing values
print(df.isna().sum())

# Dropping rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Filling missing values with a specific value
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)
```

5. **Adding or Modifying Columns**:
   - Use assignment to add new columns or modify existing ones.

```python
# Adding a new column
df['new_column'] = values

# Modifying an existing column
df['existing_column'] = df['existing_column'] * 2
```

6. **Grouping and Aggregating Data**:
   - Use `groupby()` followed by aggregation functions to group and aggregate data.

```python
# Grouping data by a column and computing the mean
grouped_data = df.groupby('column_name').mean()
```

### Data Analysis and Visualization

1. **Statistical Summary**:
   - Use `describe()` to generate descriptive statistics of the DataFrame.

```python
# Generating descriptive statistics
print(df.describe())
```

2. **Visualization**:
   - Use built-in plotting methods or integrate with libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plotting a histogram
df['column_name'].plot(kind='hist')
plt.show()
```

3. **Exporting Data**:
   - Use `to_csv()`, `to_excel()`, or other methods to export the DataFrame to external files.

```python
# Exporting DataFrame to CSV
df.to_csv('output.csv', index=False)
```

### Aggregation and groupby operations

Aggregation and `groupby()` operations in Pandas are powerful tools for summarizing and analyzing data by grouping it based on one or more categorical variables. These operations enable you to compute statistics, apply functions, and perform operations on grouped data efficiently. Here's a detailed explanation of aggregation and `groupby()` operations in Pandas:

### Groupby Operation

1. **Grouping Data**:
   - The `groupby()` function in Pandas is used to group data in a DataFrame based on one or more categorical variables.
   - It splits the DataFrame into groups based on the unique values of the specified columns.

```python
# Grouping data by a single column
grouped = df.groupby('column_name')

# Grouping data by multiple columns
grouped = df.groupby(['column1', 'column2'])
```

2. **Iterating Over Groups**:
   - Once grouped, you can iterate over the groups and perform operations on each group.

```python
# Iterating over groups
for group_name, group_data in grouped:
    print(group_name)
    print(group_data)
```

### Aggregation

1. **Aggregating Data**:
   - After grouping the data, you can apply aggregation functions to compute summary statistics for each group.

```python
# Aggregating data using built-in aggregation functions
agg_data = grouped.aggregate({'column_name': 'mean', 'other_column': 'sum'})

# Using named aggregation with Pandas >= 0.25
agg_data = grouped.agg(mean_column=('column_name', 'mean'), sum_other_column=('other_column', 'sum'))
```

2. **Applying Custom Functions**:
   - You can also apply custom aggregation functions using `agg()` or `apply()`.

```python
# Applying custom aggregation function
def custom_function(x):
    return x.max() - x.min()

agg_data = grouped['column_name'].agg(custom_function)
```

3. **Multiple Aggregation Functions**:
   - You can apply multiple aggregation functions simultaneously using a list of functions.

```python
# Applying multiple aggregation functions
agg_data = grouped['column_name'].agg(['mean', 'median', 'sum'])
```

4. **Using `describe()`**:
   - The `describe()` method provides summary statistics for each group, including count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum.

```python
# Summarizing data for each group
summary_stats = grouped['column_name'].describe()
```

5. **Transformations**:
   - Transformations allow you to perform operations on each group and return a DataFrame with the same shape as the original.

```python
# Applying transformations
transformed_data = grouped['column_name'].transform(lambda x: x - x.mean())
```

6. **Filtering Groups**:
   - You can filter groups based on group-level properties using `filter()`.

```python
# Filtering groups based on group-level properties
filtered_groups = grouped.filter(lambda x: x['column_name'].sum() > threshold)
```

### Merging and joining DataFrames

Merging and joining DataFrames in Pandas allows you to combine datasets based on common columns or indices. These operations are fundamental for integrating data from multiple sources and performing complex data manipulations. Here's a detailed explanation of merging and joining DataFrames in Pandas:

### Merging DataFrames

1. **Inner Join**:
   - An inner join merges two DataFrames based on the intersection of their keys, i.e., common values in specified columns.
   - The resulting DataFrame contains only rows where the key is present in both DataFrames.

```python
# Inner join
merged_inner = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column')
```

2. **Outer Join**:
   - An outer join merges two DataFrames based on the union of their keys, i.e., all values in specified columns.
   - The resulting DataFrame contains rows from both DataFrames, with missing values filled with NaN.

```python
# Outer join
merged_outer = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='outer')
```

3. **Left Join**:
   - A left join merges two DataFrames based on the keys from the left DataFrame.
   - The resulting DataFrame contains all rows from the left DataFrame and matching rows from the right DataFrame, with missing values filled with NaN.

```python
# Left join
merged_left = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='left')
```

4. **Right Join**:
   - A right join merges two DataFrames based on the keys from the right DataFrame.
   - The resulting DataFrame contains all rows from the right DataFrame and matching rows from the left DataFrame, with missing values filled with NaN.

```python
# Right join
merged_right = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='common_column', how='right')
```

### Joining DataFrames

1. **Inner Join (using `join()` method)**:
   - You can use the `join()` method to perform an inner join on two DataFrames based on their index.

```python
# Inner join using join() method
inner_join = df1.join(df2, how='inner')
```

2. **Left Join (using `join()` method)**:
   - You can perform a left join using the `join()` method by specifying `how='left'`.

```python
# Left join using join() method
left_join = df1.join(df2, how='left')
```

3. **Right Join (using `join()` method)**:
   - You can perform a right join using the `join()` method by specifying `how='right'`.

```python
# Right join using join() method
right_join = df1.join(df2, how='right')
```

### Concatenating DataFrames

1. **Concatenating along Rows**:
   - Use `pd.concat()` to concatenate DataFrames along rows (stacking them vertically).

```python
# Concatenating along rows
concatenated_rows = pd.concat([df1, df2])
```

2. **Concatenating along Columns**:
   - Use `pd.concat()` with `axis=1` to concatenate DataFrames along columns (joining them horizontally).

```python
# Concatenating along columns
concatenated_columns = pd.concat([df1, df2], axis=1)
```
