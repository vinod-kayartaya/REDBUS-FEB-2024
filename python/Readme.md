# Python Programming Essentials

## Introduction:

- This 3-day Python programming course is designed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of Python's fundamentals and essential libraries for data science. The course will cover key language concepts, various data structures, and introduce fundamental data science libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

## Duration:

- 3 Days (6 to 8 hours per day)

## Prerequisites:

- Participants should have a basic understanding of programming concepts. No prior knowledge of Python is required.

## Software Setup:

- Participants are required to have Python installed on their laptops. We recommend using the latest version of Python available from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Additionally, participants are encouraged to have a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice, such as VSCode or PyCharm.
